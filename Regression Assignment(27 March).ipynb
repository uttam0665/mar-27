    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "R-squared is a measure of how well a linear regression model fits the data. It is calculated as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.\n",
    "In other words, it measures the amount of variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared can take any value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the independent variable does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, while a value of 1 means that the independent variable perfectly explains the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum\\limits_i (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum\\limits_i (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "->y_i is the actual value of the dependent variable for the i-th data point\n",
    "->\\hat{y}_i is the predicted value of the dependent variable for the i-th data point\n",
    "->\\bar{y} is the mean of the dependent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator of the formula is the sum of the squared residuals, which are the differences between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "The denominator is the sum of the squared deviations from the mean, which is a measure of the total variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a percentage, so it is interpreted as the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.\n",
    "For example, an R-squared value of 0.75 means that the independent variable explains 75% of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a useful measure of how well a linear regression model fits the data. However, it is important to note that R-squared can be misleading in some cases.\n",
    "For example, if the independent variable is not a good predictor of the dependent variable, then even a high R-squared value may not be meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the limitations of R-squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "->It is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "->It can be affected by the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "->It does not take into account the distribution of the residuals.\n",
    "->Despite its limitations, R-squared is a commonly used measure of model fit in linear regression. It is a good starting point for evaluating a model, but it is important to consider other measures of model fit as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code you provided, the R-squared value is 1.0, which means that the linear regression model perfectly fits the data.\n",
    "This is a very rare occurrence, and it is likely that the model is overfitting the data. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise in the data instead of the underlying relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting, it is important to use a regularization technique, such as ridge regression or LASSO regression. \n",
    "Regularization techniques add a penalty to the model's complexity, which helps to prevent the model from fitting the noise in the data."

    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate the difference between adjusted R-squared and regular R-squared.\n",
    "Consider a model with 10 data points and 1 independent variable. The regular R-squared value for this model is 0.9. Now, let's add another independent variable to the model. \n",
    "If the new independent variable is not correlated with the dependent variable, then the regular R-squared value will increase to 0.95. However, the adjusted R-squared value will not change, because adding the new independent variable does not actually improve the fit of the model.\n",
